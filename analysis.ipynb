    "# Determining Climbing Route Styles of Mountain Project Sport Routes\n",
    "#### Clara McIntyre and Andres Rivas\n",
    "\n",
    "Mountain Project is essentially an online guidebook that contains information about rock climbing routes all over the world. It allows climbers to look at routes by location, difficulty, and/or star rating to determine what they are interested in climbing. ![Mountain Project Home Screen](Mountain_proj_home.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each route on Mountain Project there is a bunch of associated helpful information, such as the rating of the route, it's location, the difficulty, and most importantly, a text description. The Kaggle Dataset we use https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pdegner/mountain-project-rotues-and-forums?resource=download contains 116,700 of such routes from Mountain project, with their associated metadata. We are particularly interested in the text descriptions. They commonly talk about what it is like to climb the route, the type of gear needed to climb it, and also they style of climbing involved in the route. Climbing style is essentially what it is like to climb the route. Style is important because each climber tends to have a type of style they prefer, for example someone may really like routes with lots of small holds. Unfortunately, Mountain Project has no simple way to tell the style of routes without going through and reading a bunch of descriptions. Therefore, we want to see if topic models can be leveraged to determine the climbing styles involved in routes. We specifically want to focus on sport routes as opposed to trad or alpine routes because sport routes tend to have a diverse range of style. ![Mountain Project Route](Just_Do_It.png)"

    "To begin this process, we need to clean up our data and get it into a workable form for our topic model. To make this process easier we will be keeping our data in a Pandas dataframe. Our cleaning steps include removing unnecessary data columns, removing non sport routes, removing routes with no descriptions or overly long descriptions, and making sure we only include routes with English descriptions. With this cleaning process we go from having 116,700 routes in our dataset to 62,544 routes."

    "Let's also remove all non sport or top rope (TR) routes. We decide to focus on sport climbs and top ropes because trad routes or alpine most commonly have a crack style or non rock specific style which then makes it difficult for the topic model to find clear categories with other style types. Thus, by removing these types of routes we can get a more diverse set of styles in our topic modeling. Doing so cuts down the number of routes in our dataset from 116,700 to 65,298."

In addition to the stopwords from nltk.corpus, we will add more of our own that are climbing related but not climbing style related. Doing this will help make each of our topics more climbing style specific and reduce the number of non-style related topics that are generated. After training our model we look at the top 25 words per topic to start to get a sense of what each of our topics are. Then, to further understand our topics we look at the top 5 documents for each topic. By doing both of these things we can narrow down which of our topics are climbing style related and then determine which style they correspond to. Not all of our topics will be style related or correspond to one clear style. However, with those that are, we can create a mapping from the topic to a style label and use that mapping to label our routes with styles."
